  * Switch watch file to use sf redirector.
  * Patch from Alastair McKinstry to drop aalib's private library deps from
    aalib-config --libs. Programs linking to aalib should now only need to
    link with -laa. This should also remove such innecessary dependencies from
    packages using aalib. Closes: #316740
  * Fix a typo in aalib-config.1
  * Patch from Alastair McKinstry to rename binary package names to fit
    policy: aalib1 -> libaa1, aalib1-dev -> libaa1-dev, aalib-bin -> libaa-bin
    Closes: #315418
  * All packages depending on aalib need to be updated and rebuilt for
    both the slang2 transition and the rename.
  * Temporarily includes an aalib1 dummy package, to avoid dependency
    headaches. Will be removed after everything is recompiled.

aalib (1.4p5-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hacked configure (and ultimatly aalib-config) to not have gpm on the libs
    list. This lets aalib1-dev lose its dependancy on libgpmg1-dev (which is
    not available on the hurd). Programs like xaos that use the gpm mouse
    support will continue to have support for it; gpm is pulled in since the
    aalib library is linked to it. Closes: #102275
  * Reverted the changes of 1.4p5-4 since they are not now necessary (bb will
    shortly be fixed).

aalib (1.4p5-4) unstable; urgency=low

    fixed in another way.
  * Removed some cruft that crept into my cvs

aalib (1.4p4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release! (Known upstream as 1.4rc4 -- it's a release
    candidate. Version mangling is so I can call the real release 1.4r.) 
  * The aa project is alive again, updated copyright file to point to
    new homepage.
  * Most of my changes have been accepted upstream now.
  * The new upstream release includes updated config.sub/guess files,

aalib (1.2-w30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Specified explicit option to dh_makeshlibs -V, so packages built with
    this version can be used in potato as well. Closes: #69965.
  * This package should superscede all other aalib package, including aalib
    packages built by third parties who messed with the version numbers in 
    decidedly nasty ways. That's why the -w(oody) is there.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Aug 2000 11:32:18 -0700

aalib (1.2-28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed aalib-bin's section to misc (seems reasonable, as it's rather
    similar to bb, which is in there). This would fix bug #65766, but of
    course this change has no real effect unless the overrides file in

aalib (1.2-25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-Depends on autoconf, libtool, because of a race condition: if you
    have a slow box, unpacking the source package may yeild a configure.in
    that in newer than configure, and so it automatically tries to update
    configure. Closes: #52313, #52172

aalib (1.2-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * FHS. Had to use versioned dependencies to make some of the doc dir
    symlinks always work. Lintian still complains -- sigh.
  * Use dh_installinfo, so info pages are FHS too.

aalib (1.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Wrote a manual page for all the programs in the -bin package.

aalib (1.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied a patch from Arjan Opmeer <a.d.opmeer@student.utwente.nl> that
    fixes a rather complex problem that was making aalib programs crash if
    aalib was built to use slang and the program was running in text mode
    in an xterm.
  * Re-enabled slang linkage now that all the bugs with it are fixed.

aalib (1.2-8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed aacurses.c so it will actually build.
  * Fixed configure.in so slang can actually be disabled (typo).
  * Built with the curses driver instead of the slang one to work around
    whatever's making the slang driver badly fail. This fixes all apps that
    use aalib for display output, and it belongs in the frozen tree. (#27695)

aalib (1.2-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Reupload to frozen. We need this so that other programs linked with
    aalib can be recompiled for ncurses 4. It was waiting in queue for slink
    when slink froze, and got installed into potato instead. :-(

aalib (1.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt with ncurses 4.
  * Disabled building of libc5 compatability packages, they've never worked
    right and nothing uses them. (Since textdoom is stalled.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Oct 1998 14:34:47 -0800

aalib (1.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build libc5 versions of the library too. This is needed for the aavga
    package, so people can get squake working in ascii art mode.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Sep 1998 16:01:03 -0700

aalib (1.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hacked configure.in to properly link library with -lc.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Aug 1998 19:34:53 -0700

aalib (1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * For some reason it no longer built properly. Fixed some symlink creation
    so it does again.
  * Fixed calling of ldconfig so it happens only if $1 = configure.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Aug 1998 21:51:46 -0700

aalib (1.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Make postinst call ldconfig as manadated by newest packaging manual.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Apr 1998 17:28:13 -0700

aalib (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Not backward compatablie with aalib 1.0, yet the soname has not changed
    (sigh). Dealt with this in the shlibs file.
  * Build an aalib-bin package. (#17505).
  * Hacked libtool to not pass -rpath.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Mar 1998 12:40:03 -0800

aalib (1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt with debhelper 0.60 to fix several mode 444 files.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Feb 1998 12:55:56 -0800

aalib (1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run ldconfig in postinst.
  * Fixed self-referencing provides (#16720).
  * Explicitly link aa lib library with -lc, -lX11, -lslang, -lgpm,
    so dependancies get set properly. (#17656)
  * Added a Makefile to /usr/doc/aalib1-dev/examples/, to make it more 
    clear what you need to link aalib programs with.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Jan 1998 16:44:12 -0800

aalib (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release.
  * Modified Makefile.in to build shared library too, thanks to William
    Thompson <wakko@kitenet.net>.
